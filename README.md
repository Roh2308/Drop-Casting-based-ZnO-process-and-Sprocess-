# Drop-Casting-based-ZnO-process-and-Sprocess-
I will be working on the "Printing and Drop Casting based Process and Sprocess Tool" project during my internship, which focusses on creating low-cost production techniques for material deposition.  In order to comprehend the fundamentals and uses of printing and drop casting procedures, I will start with a survey of the literature.  Experiments incorporating the deposition of functional materials onto substrates with changes in parameters such as drying time, droplet size, and ink viscosity will come next.  Characterisation tools will be used to examine the films' consistency and calibre.  The primary goal is to create a standardised workflow called the Sprocess Tool, which maps ideal process parameters and offers direction for users in the future.  The efficiency and reproducibility of material production operations will be enhanced by this instrument.
